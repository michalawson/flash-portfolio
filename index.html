        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Barry Allen and I am an assistant scientist from the Criminal and Forensic Science Division of Central City Police Department. I had a reputation for being very slow, deliberate, and frequently late, which frustrated the people around me.
      One night, as I was preparing to leave work, a lightning bolt struck a nearby shelf in my lab and doused me with a cocktail of chemicals, which put me in a coma for 9 months.
      When I woke up, I was not the same man - I found that I could run extremely fast!
      I wanted to do more with my new ability and so I became a crimefighter known as The Flash.
      I store my superhero suit compressed in a special ring via the use of a special gas that could compress cloth fibers to a very small fraction of their normal size.
      Recently my civilian identity has been revealed, and Iâ€™ve decided to re-introduce myself to the world.
      My name is Barry Allen and I am The Flash!
